To setup on your own server:
----------------------------
1. unzip files and edit the file:  contact_process.php
      add your own details ($replyemail, $valid_ref1 and $valid_ref2)

     If you intend to include the contact.html file within a php file then ensure you 
      enter the correct filename and extension (.php) for the $valid_refs.  
         ie.  $valid_ref1="http://Your--domain/contact.php";

2. upload to your server (to a new folder if required)

3. Open the URL in your browser, and test it.  If all is OK then continue to 4 below. 

4. Delete the file:  "debug.flag" from your server (you should delete this file once you have it working correctly)

5. Open the URL in your browser again, and give it a final test.

Like it?  Use it?  

We understand you will most likely remove the links back to it from the html form but at least...
